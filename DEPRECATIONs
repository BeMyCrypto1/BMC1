OLD contract's deprecations are:

# bmc1x 0xae9c72ef6fc717687398c334ebb8fcf77d70ff35,

They had been identified as containing architectural weaknesses that do not align with current ecosystem standards. 
While the contracts remains on-chain, they graduately will be considered inactive removing funds back to users and all deprecated.

To prevent unintended usage, remaining token supply associated with this deployment is planned to be permanently removed 
from circulation through transfer to a dead address, effectively rendering the contract economically inactive.

This legacy deployment should be regarded as obsolete and unused. No liquidity provisioning, integrations, or official 
references will be maintained going forward. Updated contracts supersede this deployment and represent the authoritative 
versions of BMC1-related tokens.

This approach reflects standard best practices for iterative smart contract development and long-term ecosystem integrity.
